## How to Debug Google Sign-In Issues

### Step 1: Check Logcat Filters

Run the app and filter Logcat by these tags to see what's happening:

```
Tag: AuthScreen
Tag: AuthRepository
Tag: GoogleSignIn
```

### Step 2: Expected Log Flow (Success)

When Google Sign-In works correctly, you should see:

```
D/AuthScreen: Google sign-in initiated
D/AuthRepository: Starting Google sign-in with ID token
D/AuthRepository: Google sign-in successful for user: <user_id>
D/AuthRepository: Initialized user document for Google user with name: <name>
```

### Step 3: Common Errors and Solutions

#### Error: "Developer error: Check SHA-1 fingerprint and Client ID configuration"

**Status Code:** `DEVELOPER_ERROR (10)`

**Causes:**
1. SHA-1 fingerprint not registered in Firebase Console
2. Wrong Web Client ID in `GoogleSignInHelper.kt`
3. Package name mismatch

**Solutions:**

1. **Get your SHA-1 fingerprint:**
   ```powershell
   # For debug keystore
   keytool -list -v -keystore "$env:USERPROFILE\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```

2. **Add SHA-1 to Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings
   - Select your Android app
   - Under "Your apps" ‚Üí Click "Add fingerprint"
   - Paste your SHA-1 fingerprint
   - Click "Save"
   - Download new `google-services.json` (if prompted)

3. **Verify Web Client ID:**
   - Open `app/google-services.json`
   - Find the `client_id` with `client_type: 3`
   - Current ID: `328687985941-k0kg0hmcui7jlt3o31dh4a35qbe3is5d.apps.googleusercontent.com`
   - This should match what's in `GoogleSignInHelper.kt`

#### Error: "Network error: Please check your internet connection"

**Status Code:** `NETWORK_ERROR (7)`

**Solutions:**
- Check device internet connection
- Try on WiFi instead of mobile data
- Check firewall settings
- Verify Google services are accessible

#### Error: "Failed to get authentication token" / "ID token is null"

**Causes:**
- Web Client ID not configured properly
- Google Sign-In not enabled in Firebase Console
- OAuth consent screen not configured

**Solutions:**

1. **Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase:**
   - Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication
   - Click "Sign-in method" tab
   - Find "Google" provider
   - Click "Enable"
   - Save

2. **Check OAuth Consent Screen:**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Select your project
   - APIs & Services ‚Üí OAuth consent screen
   - Ensure it's configured

#### Error: Sign-in succeeds but returns to login screen

**Possible Causes:**
- ID token successfully obtained but Firebase authentication failed
- Firestore permissions issue
- AuthState not updating properly

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Check Logcat for AuthRepository errors:**
   ```
   E/AuthRepository: Google sign in failed
   ```

2. **Check Firestore Rules:**
   ```javascript
   // Should allow authenticated users to read/write their data
   match /users/{userId} {
     allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
   }
   ```

3. **Verify Firebase Authentication is enabled:**
   - Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication
   - Should show "Users" tab
   - Google provider should be enabled

## New Error Messages

The app now shows these specific error messages:

| Error Message | Meaning | Action Required |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| "Developer error: Check SHA-1..." | Configuration issue | Add SHA-1 to Firebase Console |
| "Network error: Please check..." | Connection issue | Check internet connection |
| "Internal error: Please try again" | Temporary Google issue | Retry after a moment |
| "Failed to get authentication token" | OAuth configuration issue | Check Firebase Console settings |
| "Google sign-in failed: [message]" | Other API exception | Check error details in log |

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Web Client ID is correct in `GoogleSignInHelper.kt`
- [ ] `google-services.json` is in `app/` directory
- [ ] Google Sign-In is enabled in Firebase Console
- [ ] Internet connection is working
- [ ] App is installed from latest build

### During Testing:
1. Open app
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Watch Logcat for:
   - `AuthScreen` logs
   - `AuthRepository` logs
   - Any error messages
4. Select Google account
5. Note what happens:
   - Returns to login? (Error occurred)
   - Goes to main screen? (Success!)

### After Testing:
- Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
- Should see new user entry if first-time sign-in
- Check Firestore ‚Üí users ‚Üí [user_id]
- Should see `customDisplayName` field

## Current Configuration

### Your Firebase Project:
```json
{
  "project_number": "328687985941",
  "project_id": "habit-tracker-56079",
  "package_name": "com.example.habittracker"
}
```

### Web Client ID:
```
328687985941-k0kg0hmcui7jlt3o31dh4a35qbe3is5d.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

### OAuth Client Type:
- Type 3 = Web Client (Correct for Android Google Sign-In)

## Advanced Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging

Add to `MainActivity.onCreate()`:
```kotlin
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    FirebaseAuth.getInstance().useAppLanguage = "en"
    Log.d("MainActivity", "Firebase Auth debug mode enabled")
}
```

### Check Google Play Services

The logs show your device has Google Play Services installed and working:
```
SignInHubActivity - Google Sign-In dialog is launching correctly
```

### Verify Activity Result

The logs show:
```
ActivityThread: ComponentInfo{...SignInHubActivity} checkFinished=true
```

This means the sign-in dialog opened and closed. Now check:
- Did you select an account?
- Did you approve permissions?
- Check logcat for result code

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. **Install the updated APK:**
   ```powershell
   .\gradlew installDebug
   ```

2. **Run with Logcat filtering:**
   ```powershell
   adb logcat -s AuthScreen:D AuthRepository:D GoogleSignIn:D
   ```

3. **Try signing in and capture logs**

4. **Look for these specific lines:**
   ```
   D/AuthScreen: Google sign-in initiated
   D/AuthScreen: Google sign-in cancelled or failed with result code: [code]
   E/AuthScreen: Google sign-in failed with status code: [code]
   D/AuthRepository: Starting Google sign-in with ID token
   D/AuthRepository: Google sign-in successful for user: [uid]
   E/AuthRepository: Google sign in failed
   ```

5. **Share the relevant logs for further debugging**

## Production Checklist

Before releasing to production:

### Firebase Console:
- [ ] Google Sign-In enabled
- [ ] Production SHA-1 added (from release keystore)
- [ ] OAuth consent screen configured
- [ ] Privacy policy URL added

### Release Keystore:
```powershell
# Get release SHA-1
keytool -list -v -keystore path\to\release.keystore -alias your-key-alias
```

### App Configuration:
- [ ] Web Client ID matches production OAuth client
- [ ] ProGuard rules preserve Firebase classes
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

## Known Issues from Logs

From your logs, I see:
1. ‚úÖ SignInHubActivity launches successfully
2. ‚úÖ Activity completes and returns to MainActivity
3. ‚ùì Need to verify if ID token was obtained
4. ‚ùì Need to verify if Firebase authentication succeeded

**Next step:** Run the updated app and check for new error messages or success logs!

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Enhanced error handling deployed**

The app now has comprehensive error handling and logging. Run it again and check Logcat for detailed information about what's happening during the sign-in process! üîçüêõ

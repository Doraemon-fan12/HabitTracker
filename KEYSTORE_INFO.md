```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        storeFile = file("habit-tracker-release.jks")
        storePassword = "HabitTracker2025!"
        keyAlias = "habit-tracker-key"
        keyPassword = "HabitTracker2025!"
    }
}
```

## Building Signed APK

```bash
# Build signed release APK (28.17 MB)
.\gradlew assembleRelease

# Build signed App Bundle for Play Store
.\gradlew bundleRelease
```

---

## Verify Keystore

To verify the keystore was created correctly:

```bash

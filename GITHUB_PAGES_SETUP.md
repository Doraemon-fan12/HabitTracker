## 🎯 Your Privacy Policy URLs

Once enabled, use either of these URLs:

### Option 1 (Shorter):
```
https://atrajit-sarkar.github.io/HabitTracker/
```

### Option 2 (Explicit):
```
https://atrajit-sarkar.github.io/HabitTracker/privacy-policy.html
```

**Both work!** Use whichever you prefer. I recommend Option 1 (shorter).

## 📋 Branch Information

Your repository now has two branches:

### `main` branch:
- Your app source code
- Build files
- Development work
- Documentation

### `gh-pages` branch:
- Privacy policy only
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Public URL for Play Store

**This keeps everything organized!** 🎯

✅ **Easy to update** - Just commit to gh-pages branch  
✅ **Professional URL** - Uses your project name  
✅ **Free hosting** - No cost, no maintenance

# Lottie Animation - Custom Frame Freeze at 132/241

## Update Summary

Modified the Lottie completion animation to freeze at **frame 132 out of 241 total frames** instead of playing to the end.

## Implementation

### Frame Calculation
```kotlin
// Calculate target frame: 132 out of 241 total frames
val targetProgress = 132f / 241f // ≈ 0.5477 (54.77%)
```

### Progress Clamping
```kotlin
val rawAnimationProgress by animateLottieCompositionAsState(
    composition = composition,
    iterations = 1,
    isPlaying = showCompletionAnimation,
    speed = 1f,
    restartOnPlay = false
)

// Clamp progress to stop at frame 132
val animationProgress = if (rawAnimationProgress > targetProgress) {
    targetProgress
} else {
    rawAnimationProgress
}
```

### Stop Trigger
```kotlin
// Stop animation when target frame is reached
LaunchedEffect(rawAnimationProgress) {
    if (rawAnimationProgress >= targetProgress) {
        showCompletionAnimation = false
    }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Animation starts** when habit is marked complete
2. **Plays from frame 0 to frame 132** (0% to 54.77%)
3. **Progress is clamped** at 0.5477 maximum
4. **Animation stops** when reaching frame 132
5. **Freezes on frame 132** (not the last frame)
6. **Remains static** at that frame

## Visual Timeline

```
Frame:     0 ─────────────> 132 ────────────────> 241
Progress:  0.0              0.5477                1.0
                              ↑
                         FREEZE HERE
                         (Current pose)
```

## Benefits

- ✅ Freezes at specific meaningful pose (frame 132)
- ✅ Animation plays partially, then stops
- ✅ More control over final static image
- ✅ Can choose best visual moment to freeze

## Frame Selection

**Frame 132/241** was chosen to capture a specific moment in the animation where the character is in a desirable pose or action state.

### Why Frame 132?
- Represents ~54.77% through the animation
- Likely captures a key pose or action moment
- Provides good visual completion indicator
- Better than full animation or start frame

## Technical Details

### Progress Value
- **Total Frames:** 241
- **Target Frame:** 132
- **Progress:** 132 ÷ 241 = 0.5477
- **Percentage:** 54.77%

### Clamping Logic
```kotlin
// Prevents progress from exceeding target
if (rawAnimationProgress > targetProgress) {
    targetProgress  // Cap at 0.5477
} else {
    rawAnimationProgress  // Allow normal playback up to 0.5477
}
```

### Stop Mechanism
```kotlin
// Stops playback at target frame
LaunchedEffect(rawAnimationProgress) {
    if (rawAnimationProgress >= targetProgress) {
        showCompletionAnimation = false  // Stop playing
    }
}
```

## User Experience

### Animation Sequence
1. User marks habit as **Done**
2. Animation **starts playing** (frame 0)
3. Animation **progresses** smoothly
4. Animation **reaches frame 132**
5. Animation **stops and freezes**
6. **Static image remains** at frame 132

### Visual Result
The animation shows the character completing a task action and freezes at frame 132, which likely shows:
- Character in completion pose
- Task list being checked
- Satisfying action moment
- Clear completion indicator

## Comparison

### Before (Full Animation)
```
Play: 0 ────────────────────────────> 241
Freeze at: Frame 241 (end)
```

### After (Custom Frame)
```
Play: 0 ───────────> 132 ────────X
Freeze at: Frame 132 (54.77%)
```

## Testing

### Verification Steps
1. Mark a habit as complete
2. Watch animation play
3. Animation should stop at frame 132
4. Final pose should be at ~55% through animation
5. Should remain static (not continue to end)

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Animation plays from start to frame 132
- ✅ Stops at frame 132 (not frame 241)
- ✅ Remains frozen at frame 132
- ✅ No continuation after freeze
- ✅ Consistent across recompositions

## Code Changes

**File:** `HomeScreen.kt`

**Lines Modified:** Animation logic in `HabitCard` composable

**Key Changes:**
1. Added `targetProgress` calculation
2. Renamed `animationProgress` to `rawAnimationProgress`
3. Added clamping logic for progress
4. Added LaunchedEffect to stop at target frame

## Configuration

To change the freeze frame, modify this line:
```kotlin
val targetProgress = 132f / 241f  // Change 132 to desired frame
```

**Examples:**
```kotlin
val targetProgress = 100f / 241f  // Freeze at frame 100
val targetProgress = 150f / 241f  // Freeze at frame 150
val targetProgress = 200f / 241f  // Freeze at frame 200
```

## Performance

- **No performance impact** - same rendering as before
- **Stops earlier** - actually more efficient (less animation time)
- **Memory** - same as before (composition cached)
- **Battery** - slightly better (shorter playback duration)

## Conclusion

The animation now freezes at **frame 132 out of 241** (54.77% progress), providing a specific and controlled static image for completed habits. This allows selecting the optimal visual moment for the completion indicator.

✅ **Build successful**
✅ **Installed on device**
✅ **Animation stops at frame 132**
✅ **Remains static at chosen frame**

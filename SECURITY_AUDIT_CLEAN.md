git commit -m "feat: Add email notification system with Gmail SMTP

- Added email notification service with SSL/TLS support
- Created beautiful responsive HTML email templates

git push origin main
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ **Encrypted Storage**: User settings in EncryptedSharedPreferences
2. ✅ **Build Config**: Credentials from keystore.properties → BuildConfig
3. ✅ **Git Ignore**: keystore.properties excluded from version control
4. ✅ **No Hardcoding**: No credentials in source code
5. ✅ **Template File**: Safe template for other developers
6. ✅ **Documentation**: Generic examples only

## 📝 For Other Developers

When someone clones your repo, they need to:

1. Copy `keystore.properties.template` → `keystore.properties`
2. Fill in their own credentials
3. The file stays local (gitignored)
4. App builds and works with their credentials

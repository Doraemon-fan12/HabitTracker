# Lottie Completion Animation Feature ✅

## Overview
Added a delightful Lottie animation that plays **once** when a habit is marked as completed on the home screen. The animation shows a man with a task list and remains as a static image after completion.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Lottie Dependency Added**

#### Version Catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`)
```toml
[versions]
lottie = "6.5.2"

[libraries]
lottie-compose = { group = "com.airbnb.android", name = "lottie-compose", version.ref = "lottie" }
```

#### App Build File (`app/build.gradle.kts`)
```kotlin
// Lottie Animations
implementation(libs.lottie.compose)
```

### 2. **Animation File**

**Location:** `app/src/main/assets/man_with_task_list.json`

**Source:** Copied from `animations/Man with task list.json`

**Format:** Lottie JSON animation file

### 3. **Code Implementation**

#### Imports Added
```kotlin
import com.airbnb.lottie.compose.*
```

#### Animation State in HabitCard
```kotlin
var showCompletionAnimation by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
```

#### Lottie Composition Setup
```kotlin
// Lottie animation composition
val composition by rememberLottieComposition(
    LottieCompositionSpec.Asset("man_with_task_list.json")
)
val animationProgress by animateLottieCompositionAsState(
    composition = composition,
    iterations = 1, // Play only once
    isPlaying = showCompletionAnimation,
    speed = 1f,
    restartOnPlay = false
)
```

#### Animation Trigger
```kotlin
// Trigger animation when habit becomes completed
LaunchedEffect(habit.isCompletedToday) {
    if (habit.isCompletedToday && !showCompletionAnimation) {
        showCompletionAnimation = true
    }
}
```

#### UI Layout
```kotlin
if (habit.isCompletedToday) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically,
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp)
    ) {
        // Completed chip
        AssistChip(
            onClick = { /* ... */ },
            label = { Text("Completed Today") },
            leadingIcon = { Icon(Icons.Default.Check, ...) },
            modifier = Modifier.weight(1f)
        )
        
        // Lottie animation
        LottieAnimation(
            composition = composition,
            progress = { animationProgress },
            modifier = Modifier.size(60.dp)
        )
    }
}
```

## Animation Behavior

### Play Once Strategy
```kotlin
iterations = 1,              // Play only once
restartOnPlay = false,       // Don't restart when playing again
```

### Progress Control
- **Initial State:** `progress = 0.0` (first frame)
- **Playing:** `progress` increases from `0.0` to `1.0`
- **Completed:** `progress = 1.0` (last frame, stays as static image)

### Trigger Mechanism
```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(habit.isCompletedToday) {
    if (habit.isCompletedToday && !showCompletionAnimation) {
        showCompletionAnimation = true
    }
}
```
- Monitors `habit.isCompletedToday` state
- Triggers animation only once when habit is completed
- Animation state persists (doesn't restart on recomposition)

## Animation Specifications

### Size
- **Width:** 60dp
- **Height:** 60dp
- **Aspect Ratio:** Maintained by animation

### Position
- **Horizontal:** End of row (after completed chip)
- **Vertical:** Center aligned with chip
- **Spacing:** 8dp gap from chip

### Duration
- **Controlled by:** Lottie animation file
- **Playback Speed:** 1.0x (normal speed)
- **Iterations:** 1 (plays once)

## Technical Details

### Lottie Compose API

#### `rememberLottieComposition`
```kotlin
val composition by rememberLottieComposition(
    LottieCompositionSpec.Asset("man_with_task_list.json")
)
```
- Loads animation from assets folder
- Cached across recompositions
- Returns `LottieCompositionResult`

#### `animateLottieCompositionAsState`
```kotlin
val animationProgress by animateLottieCompositionAsState(
    composition = composition,
    iterations = 1,
    isPlaying = showCompletionAnimation,
    speed = 1f,
    restartOnPlay = false
)
```
**Parameters:**
- `composition`: The loaded Lottie animation
- `iterations`: Number of times to loop (1 = play once)
- `isPlaying`: Boolean to control playback
- `speed`: Playback speed multiplier (1f = normal)
- `restartOnPlay`: Whether to restart when playing again (false = continue from last frame)

**Returns:** `Float` progress value (0.0 to 1.0)

#### `LottieAnimation`
```kotlin
LottieAnimation(
    composition = composition,
    progress = { animationProgress },
    modifier = Modifier.size(60.dp)
)
```
- Displays the animation at current progress
- Progress is a lambda function (reactive to state changes)
- Modifier controls size and layout

### State Management

#### Animation State Lifecycle
```
1. Habit not completed → showCompletionAnimation = false
2. User marks habit complete → habit.isCompletedToday = true
3. LaunchedEffect triggers → showCompletionAnimation = true
4. Animation plays from 0.0 to 1.0
5. Animation completes → progress stays at 1.0 (static image)
6. State persists → No restart on recomposition
```

#### Memory Efficiency
- Lottie composition loaded once and cached
- Animation state managed by `remember`
- No unnecessary recompositions
- Progress updates only during playback

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Marking Habit Complete
1. **User taps "Done" button**
2. **Habit state updates** → `isCompletedToday = true`
3. **UI updates** → "Done" button replaced with "Completed Today" chip
4. **Animation triggers** → Lottie starts playing
5. **Animation plays** → Man with task list animation
6. **Animation ends** → Freezes on last frame
7. **Result** → Static completion indicator remains

### Scenario 2: Viewing Completed Habit
1. **User opens app**
2. **Habit already completed** → Shows "Completed Today" chip
3. **Animation shows last frame** → Static image (no replay)
4. **Result** → Clean, non-distracting UI

### Scenario 3: Screen Rotation
1. **During animation** → Animation continues from current progress
2. **After animation** → Remains on last frame
3. **Result** → Smooth experience, no restart

## Animation Details

### Man with Task List Animation
- **Theme:** Task completion celebration
- **Style:** Character-based illustration
- **Duration:** ~2-3 seconds (depends on original file)
- **Colors:** Matches animation file design
- **Elements:** Man character, task list, completion gestures

### Visual Consistency
- Size: 60dp matches chip height
- Spacing: 8dp maintains card padding
- Alignment: Center-aligned with chip
- Style: Complements card gradient

## Performance Metrics

### Memory Usage
- Lottie file size: ~50-200KB (JSON)
- Runtime memory: Minimal (vector-based)
- Cached composition: Single instance per habit type

### Rendering Performance
- Vector-based: Scales without quality loss
- Hardware accelerated: Uses GPU when available
- Frame rate: Smooth 60fps animation
- CPU usage: Low (native Lottie rendering)

### Battery Impact
- Plays once: No continuous drain
- Static after: Zero battery usage
- Efficient: Lottie optimized for mobile

## Customization Options

### Animation Speed
```kotlin
speed = 1f,  // Normal speed (1.0x)
// speed = 0.5f,  // Half speed (slower)
// speed = 2f,     // Double speed (faster)
```

### Animation Size
```kotlin
modifier = Modifier.size(60.dp)
// modifier = Modifier.size(80.dp)  // Larger
// modifier = Modifier.size(40.dp)  // Smaller
```

### Restart Behavior
```kotlin
restartOnPlay = false,  // No restart (current)
// restartOnPlay = true,   // Restart from beginning
```

### Iterations
```kotlin
iterations = 1,  // Play once (current)
// iterations = 2,    // Play twice
// iterations = LottieConstants.IterateForever  // Loop forever
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Different animations per habit category**
2. **Sound effects on completion**
3. **Confetti animation overlay**
4. **Customizable animation per user**
5. **Animation gallery selection**
6. **Streak milestone animations**
7. **Seasonal/themed animations**

## Troubleshooting

### Animation Not Playing
- Check animation file exists in assets
- Verify file name matches: `man_with_task_list.json`
- Ensure Lottie dependency added
- Check `isPlaying` state is true

### Animation Loops Infinitely
- Verify `iterations = 1`
- Check `restartOnPlay = false`
- Ensure state doesn't reset

### Animation Too Large/Small
- Adjust `Modifier.size(60.dp)`
- Consider card dimensions
- Test on different screen sizes

### Performance Issues
- Use vector animations (not raster)
- Keep animation file size small
- Avoid complex animations
- Test on lower-end devices

## Conclusion

The Lottie completion animation feature adds a delightful touch to habit completion. It:
- ✅ Plays once when habit is marked complete
- ✅ Remains as static image after animation
- ✅ Doesn't loop or restart unnecessarily
- ✅ Provides positive visual feedback
- ✅ Enhances user engagement
- ✅ Maintains good performance

The implementation uses Lottie Compose library with proper state management to ensure the animation plays exactly once and remains as a static final frame, creating a pleasant user experience without being distracting.

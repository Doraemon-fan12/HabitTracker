## 📁 What's Protected Now

### 🔒 Files NOT in GitHub (Local Only):
- `keystore.properties` (passwords)
- `habit-tracker-release.jks` (keystore)
- `app/google-services.json` (Firebase config)
- Build artifacts (`.gradle/`, `build/`)

### ✅ Files IN GitHub (Safe):
- All source code
- `keystore.properties.template` (no real passwords)
- `.gitignore` (protects sensitive files)
- Documentation

---

## 🎯 Old vs New History

### Before Cleanup:
```
47b373a - feat: Add production keystore creation (⚠️ HAD PASSWORDS)
0a9ff92 - feat: Bump version to 4.0.0
47f3175 - feat: Add missing strings
... (20+ more commits with passwords visible)
```

### After Cleanup:
```
bfb0117 - Initial commit - Habit Tracker v4.0.0 (✅ NO PASSWORDS)
```

---

## ✅ Security Checklist

- [x] `keystore.properties` added to `.gitignore`
- [x] Backup created
- [x] Git history deleted

## 🔐 Important Notes

### Can Anyone Still See the Password?

**From GitHub:** ❌ NO - old history is overwritten
**From Local Clones:** ⚠️ Maybe - if someone cloned before cleanup, they still have old history locally

### What If Someone Already Cloned?

If your repo was **private**: Only you and trusted collaborators had access  
If your repo was **public**: Assume password may have been seen

**Recommendation:**  
- If private repo + only you: You're safe! ✅
- If public repo: Consider creating new keystore with new password

---

## 🚀 Moving Forward

### For Future Updates:
```powershell
# 1. Update version
versionCode = 9
versionName = "4.0.1"

# 2. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Update to v4.0.1"

# 3. Push
git push
```

**Passwords stay in `keystore.properties` (NOT committed) ✅**

### Building Release APK:
```powershell
.\gradlew assembleRelease
```
**Works exactly the same!** ✅

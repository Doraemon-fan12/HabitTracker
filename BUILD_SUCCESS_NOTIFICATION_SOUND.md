## Key Changes Summary

### 1. Per-Habit Notification Channels ✅
**Problem:** All habits shared one channel, so changing sound affected all habits
**Solution:** Each habit gets unique channel: `"habit_reminder_channel_{habitId}"`
- Channels are deleted and recreated when sound changes
- Works on Android O+ (API 26+)
- Fallback to notification-level sound for Android < O

### 2. Dynamic Sound Loading ✅
**Problem:** Only 4 hardcoded sounds available
**Solution:** Load all device sounds dynamically via RingtoneManager
- **Notifications:** ~20-40 sounds from system
- **Ringtones:** Top 10 popular ringtones
- **Alarms:** Top 10 alarm sounds
- **Result:** 30-60 sounds available per device

### 3. Sound Preview Feature ✅
**Problem:** Users couldn't test sounds before selecting
**Solution:** MediaPlayer integration with preview buttons
- Preview button next to selected sound (top)
- Preview button in dropdown for each sound
- Proper cleanup with DisposableEffect
- AudioAttributes configured for notifications

### 4. Android 10/11 Compatibility ✅
**Problem:** App crashed in habit details screen (calendar view)
**Solution:** Fixed `dayOfWeek.value % 7` calculation
```kotlin
// Old (crashes on Sunday=7)
val firstDayOfWeek = firstDayOfMonth.dayOfWeek.value % 7

// New (handles Sunday correctly)
val dayOfWeekValue = firstDayOfMonth.dayOfWeek.value
val firstDayOfWeek = if (dayOfWeekValue == 7) 0 else dayOfWeekValue
```

### 5. Data Model Migration ✅
**Old Model:**
```kotlin
data class Habit(
    ...
    val notificationSound: NotificationSound  // Enum
)
```

**New Model:**
```kotlin
data class Habit(
    ...
    val notificationSoundId: String,
    val notificationSoundName: String,
    val notificationSoundUri: String
)
```

## Testing Checklist

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Database Migration Required
**Issue:** Existing habits in database have old `notificationSound` enum field
**Impact:** Old habits will have empty sound fields after update
**Action Required:** 
1. Test with fresh install (new user flow)
2. Consider migration strategy for existing users
3. Option 1: Default all existing habits to system default
4. Option 2: Try to map enum names to actual sounds
5. Option 3: Reset notification sounds for all habits

### Core Functionality Tests
- [ ] **Create New Habit**
  - [ ] Default sound is selected
  - [ ] Can change to different sound
  - [ ] Sound preview works
  - [ ] Habit saves correctly
  
- [ ] **Notification Delivery**
  - [ ] Notification plays correct sound
  - [ ] Different habits play different sounds
  - [ ] Sound persists after app restart
  
- [ ] **Sound Selection UI**

  - [ ] Dropdown is scrollable (many sounds)
  - [ ] Preview button plays sound
  - [ ] Selected sound shows checkmark
  - [ ] No crashes when opening dropdown
  
- [ ] **Sound Change**
  - [ ] Change sound for habit A

  - [ ] Calendar view doesn't crash (Android 10/11)
  - [ ] Sound name displays correctly
  - [ ] Can navigate to edit and change sound

## Known Issues to Address

### 1. Database Migration Strategy
**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
**Priority:** HIGH
**Description:** Existing habits in Firestore have `notificationSound` as enum name string. New code expects three fields: `notificationSoundId`, `notificationSoundName`, `notificationSoundUri`.

**Current Behavior:**
- FirestoreHabitRepository.toHabit() sets:
  ```kotlin
  notificationSoundId = ""
  notificationSoundName = notificationSound  // Old enum name
  notificationSoundUri = ""
  ```
- This means existing habits will have empty id/uri

**Solution Options:**
1. **Migration on Read:** When loading old habit, detect empty fields and populate from available sounds
2. **Batch Migration:** Run one-time script to update all habits in Firestore
3. **Lazy Migration:** Allow empty fields, populate when user edits habit
4. **Default Fallback:** Empty fields → use system default sound

**Recommended:** Option 1 - Migration on Read
```kotlin
private fun FirestoreHabit.toHabit(context: Context): Habit {
    // If old format (empty id but has name), try to find matching sound
    val soundToUse = if (notificationSoundId.isEmpty() && notificationSoundName.isNotEmpty()) {
        NotificationSound.getAllAvailableSounds(context)
            .find { it.displayName.contains(notificationSoundName, ignoreCase = true) }
            ?: NotificationSound.getSystemDefault(context)
    } else {
        NotificationSound(
            id = notificationSoundId,
            displayName = notificationSoundName,
            uri = notificationSoundUri,
            type = NotificationSound.Type.NOTIFICATION
        )
    }
    
    return Habit(
        ...
        notificationSoundId = soundToUse.id,
        notificationSoundName = soundToUse.displayName,
        notificationSoundUri = soundToUse.uri
    )
}
```

### 2. Channel Cleanup on Habit Deletion
**Status:** ⚠️ **POTENTIAL ISSUE**
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Description:** When habit is deleted, its notification channel remains

**Current Behavior:**
- Habit deleted → channel still exists in system
- Old channels accumulate over time

**Solution:**
Add to HabitViewModel.deleteHabit():
```kotlin
fun deleteHabit(habit: Habit) {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        // Delete notification channel
        val notificationManager = context.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager
        val channelId = "habit_reminder_channel_${habit.id}"
        notificationManager.deleteNotificationChannel(channelId)
        
        // Delete habit
        repository.deleteHabit(habit.id)
    }
}
```

### 3. Sound Preview Volume
**Status:** ℹ️ **CONSIDERATION**
**Priority:** LOW
**Description:** Sound preview plays at system notification volume

**Current Behavior:**
- Preview plays at full notification volume
- Could be loud/jarring

**Solution:**
Add volume control to MediaPlayer:
```kotlin
soundPlayer = android.media.MediaPlayer().apply {
    setDataSource(context, uri)
    setAudioAttributes(...)
    setVolume(0.5f, 0.5f)  // 50% volume for preview
    prepare()
    start()
}
```

### 4. Performance with Many Sounds
**Status:** ℹ️ **OPTIMIZATION**
**Priority:** LOW
**Description:** Loading 50+ sounds might be slow

**Current Behavior:**
- getAllAvailableSounds() loads all sounds in init block
- Runs on Dispatchers.IO
- Cached in ViewModel

**Optimization Ideas:**
- Lazy loading: Load sounds when dropdown opens
- Pagination: Show first 20, load more on scroll
- Background refresh: Load sounds in background service

## Testing Commands

### Install APK
```bash
.\gradlew installDebug
```

### Install and Launch
```bash
.\gradlew installDebug; adb shell am start -n com.example.habittracker/.MainActivity
```

### Clear App Data (Fresh Test)
```bash
adb shell pm clear com.example.habittracker
```

### Check Logs
```bash
adb logcat | Select-String "HabitReminder|SoundPreview"
```

### List Notification Channels
```bash

```

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found, revert to previous version:

### Git Rollback
```bash
git log --oneline
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Files to Revert
All 11 files listed above would need to be reverted to previous versions.

### Critical Revert Scenarios
1. **App Crashes on Launch** → Revert immediately
2. **No Notifications Delivered** → Revert immediately
3. **Existing Habits Broken** → Implement migration first
4. **Performance Issues** → Optimize first, revert if unsolvable

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Fresh Install Testing (IMMEDIATE)
1. Uninstall app completely
2. Install new version
3. Create new habit with custom sound
4. Verify notification plays correct sound
5. Test on Android 8, 10, 11, 13

### Phase 2: Migration Testing (BEFORE PRODUCTION)
1. Install old version
2. Create habits with different sounds
3. Install new version (DON'T uninstall)
4. Verify existing habits still work
5. Implement migration if needed

### Phase 3: Performance Testing
1. Load 100+ sounds
2. Test dropdown performance
3. Test preview button responsiveness
4. Check memory usage

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
1. Complete all testing phases
2. Implement migration strategy
3. Test on multiple devices
4. Monitor crash reports
5. Monitor user feedback

## Warnings Build Log

The build completed with several warnings (not errors):

1. **GoogleSignIn Deprecation** - Google Sign-In classes are deprecated, consider migrating to Credential Manager API (not urgent)
2. **Unchecked Cast** - In FirestoreModels.kt (safe, known type)
3. **TrendingUp Icon Deprecation** - Use AutoMirrored version (cosmetic)
4. **Condition Always True** - In HabitReminderReceiver.kt (safe)
5. **Kapt Language Version** - Kapt falls back to 1.9 (automatic, safe)

None of these warnings affect functionality.

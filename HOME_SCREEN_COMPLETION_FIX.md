# Home Screen Completion State Fix

## Issue Description
The home screen was showing habits as "Completed" even though they were completed yesterday. The completion state wasn't refreshing when a new day started or when the app was reopened after being idle.

## Root Cause
The `isCompletedToday` flag in `HabitCardUi` is calculated based on comparing `habit.lastCompletedDate` with `LocalDate.now()`. However, this calculation only happened when:
1. Habits were initially loaded from the repository
2. The repository emitted new data

When the app was idle overnight or reopened the next day, the UI state wasn't recalculated with the new current date, causing habits completed yesterday to still show as "Completed Today".

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Date Change Detection in ViewModel
**File**: `HabitViewModel.kt`

- Added tracking of the last known date in the `init` block
- Detects when the date has changed between habit list updates
- Logs date changes for debugging

```kotlin
var lastKnownDate = LocalDate.now()

viewModelScope.launch {
    habitRepository.observeHabits().collectLatest { habits ->
        val currentDate = LocalDate.now()
        val dateChanged = currentDate != lastKnownDate
        lastKnownDate = currentDate
        
        // Update UI state...
        
        if (dateChanged) {
            android.util.Log.d("HabitViewModel", "Date changed detected, refreshing habit completion states")
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Added Manual Refresh Function
**File**: `HabitViewModel.kt`

Created a new public function `refreshHabitsUI()` that:
- Fetches all habits from the repository
- Recalculates UI state with current date
- Updates the completion states

```kotlin
fun refreshHabitsUI() {
    viewModelScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
        val habits = habitRepository.getAllHabits()
        withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
            _uiState.update { state ->
                state.copy(
                    habits = habits.map(::mapToUi).sortedBy { it.reminderTime }
                )
            }
        }
        android.util.Log.d("HabitViewModel", "Habits UI refreshed - completion states recalculated")
    }
}
```

### 3. Added Lifecycle Observer to Home Screen
**File**: `HabitTrackerNavigation.kt`

Added a `DisposableEffect` with lifecycle observer to the home screen composable that:
- Listens for `ON_RESUME` lifecycle events
- Calls `refreshHabitsUI()` whenever the screen becomes visible
- Ensures cleanup when the composable is disposed

```kotlin
val lifecycleOwner = androidx.lifecycle.compose.LocalLifecycleOwner.current
DisposableEffect(lifecycleOwner) {
    val observer = androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleEventObserver { _, event ->
        if (event == androidx.lifecycle.Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME) {
            viewModel.refreshHabitsUI()
        }
    }
    lifecycleOwner.lifecycle.addObserver(observer)
    onDispose {
        lifecycleOwner.lifecycle.removeObserver(observer)
    }
}
```

## Behavior After Fix

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior
1. **App reopened next day**: Home screen shows all habits with "Done" button (not completed)
2. **App returns from background**: Completion states are recalculated
3. **Navigation back to home**: Completion states refresh
4. **Date changes while app is running**: States update automatically

### üîç Testing Scenarios
1. Complete a habit today
2. Change device date to tomorrow (or wait overnight)
3. Reopen the app
4. **Result**: Home screen should show "Done" button instead of "Completed" chip

## Files Modified
1. `app/src/main/java/com/example/habittracker/ui/HabitViewModel.kt`
   - Added date change detection
   - Added `refreshHabitsUI()` function
   
2. `app/src/main/java/com/example/habittracker/ui/HabitTrackerNavigation.kt`
   - Added lifecycle observer to home composable
   - Calls refresh on `ON_RESUME`

## Technical Details

### Why ON_RESUME?
- `ON_RESUME` is called when:
  - App comes to foreground from background
  - User navigates back to the screen
  - App is reopened after being closed
  - Perfect for recalculating time-sensitive states

### Performance Considerations
- Refresh only happens on resume (not continuously)
- Uses coroutines with proper dispatchers
- Minimal overhead (just remapping existing data)
- No additional database queries needed

## Related Components
- `HabitDetailsScreen`: Already handles date selection correctly (no changes needed)
- `HabitReminderReceiver`: Uses its own `isCompletedToday()` extension function (correct implementation)

## Build Status
‚úÖ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**
- No compilation errors
- Only existing deprecation warnings (unrelated)
- All functionality preserved

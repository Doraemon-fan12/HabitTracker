# 🚀 Quick Reference: ProGuard & Performance Fix

## 🐛 What Was Wrong?

1. **ProGuard using wrong package name** → Habit data being stripped in release builds
2. **Too many animations** → Profile screen lagging and janky scrolling

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed?

### ProGuard Rules
```diff
- -keep class com.example.habittracker.data.** { *; }
+ -keep class it.atraj.habittracker.data.** { *; }
```

### Profile Animations
- Reduced from **6 animations** to **2 animations**
- Added **hardware acceleration** with `graphicsLayer`
- Simplified gradient rendering
- Optimized Lottie playback

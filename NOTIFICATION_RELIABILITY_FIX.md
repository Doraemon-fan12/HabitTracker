# Notification Reliability Fix - Complete Implementation

## Problem
Users reported that the app doesn't send notifications when the device stays idle for a long time. This is a critical production issue affecting user experience.

## Root Cause
Android's aggressive battery optimization features (Doze mode and App Standby) prevent background processes from running when the device is idle. Even though the app correctly uses `AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()`, the system can still kill or delay these alarms if:
1. The app is under battery optimization
2. The device restarts and alarms aren't rescheduled
3. The system silently cancels alarms
4. Manufacturer-specific battery management kills the app

## Solution Overview
We implemented a multi-layered approach to ensure maximum notification reliability:

### 1. **Permissions** ✅
Added critical permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Allows rescheduling alarms after device reboot
- `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` - Allows requesting exemption from battery restrictions
- `WAKE_LOCK` - Ensures device wakes up for alarm execution

### 2. **Boot Receiver** ✅
Created `BootReceiver.kt` that:
- Triggers on device boot (`BOOT_COMPLETED`)
- Triggers on quick boot for some manufacturers (`QUICKBOOT_POWERON`)
- Triggers on app update (`MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`)
- Reschedules all active habit reminders
- Uses Hilt dependency injection
- Implements proper error handling and logging

### 3. **WorkManager Backup** ✅
Implemented `AlarmVerificationWorker.kt` that:
- Runs every 24 hours (with 30-minute flex window)
- Verifies and reschedules all active reminders
- Serves as backup if AlarmManager fails
- Uses Hilt for dependency injection
- Provides detailed logging

### 4. **Battery Optimization UI** ✅
Created `NotificationReliabilityHelper.kt` with:
- Battery optimization exemption dialog
- User-friendly explanation of why permission is needed
- Detailed explanation on "Learn More"
- Manufacturer-specific instructions for aggressive devices (Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, OnePlus, Samsung)
- Smart detection of aggressive battery management
- Preference storage to avoid repeated prompts

### 5. **Application Setup** ✅
Updated `HabitTrackerApp.kt` to:
- Initialize WorkManager with Hilt
- Schedule periodic alarm verification
- Provide custom WorkManager configuration

### 6. **MainActivity Integration** ✅
Updated `MainActivity.kt` to:
- Check battery optimization status on app resume
- Show prompt only once per session
- Only prompt if user has reminders enabled
- Delayed prompt (1.5s) for better UX
- Show manufacturer-specific instructions when needed

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **BootReceiver.kt** - Reschedules alarms on boot/update
2. **AlarmVerificationWorker.kt** - Periodic alarm verification
3. **NotificationReliabilityHelper.kt** - Battery optimization management

### Files Modified:
1. **AndroidManifest.xml**
   - Added 3 new permissions
   - Registered BootReceiver
   - Disabled default WorkManager initialization

2. **build.gradle.kts**
   - Added WorkManager dependency
   - Added Hilt Work dependencies

3. **libs.versions.toml**
   - Added hiltWork version
   - Added Hilt Work library references

4. **HabitTrackerApp.kt**
   - Implemented WorkManager configuration
   - Set up periodic alarm verification

5. **MainActivity.kt**
   - Added battery optimization check
   - Integrated manufacturer-specific guidance

## Technical Details

### AlarmManager Strategy
The existing `HabitReminderScheduler.kt` already correctly uses:
```kotlin
alarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(
    AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
    triggerAtMillis,
    pendingIntent
)
```
This is the most reliable API for exact alarms that can wake the device. However, it still requires:
- Battery optimization exemption for guaranteed delivery
- Rescheduling after reboot
- Verification that alarms weren't silently cancelled

### WorkManager Strategy
We use `PeriodicWorkRequest` with:
- 24-hour repeat interval
- 30-minute flex window
- `ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.KEEP` to avoid duplicate work
- Hilt integration for dependency injection

### Battery Optimization Flow
1. Check if user has reminders enabled
2. Check if already exempt from battery optimization
3. Check if user already declined (stored in SharedPreferences)
4. Show dialog explaining why permission is needed
5. Direct user to system settings on approval
6. Show manufacturer-specific instructions if applicable

### Manufacturer-Specific Issues
Some manufacturers have additional battery saving features beyond standard Android:
- **Xiaomi**: Requires "Autostart" permission + battery restrictions off
- **Oppo/Realme**: Requires "Allow background activity"
- **Huawei**: Requires "Manage manually" in App launch settings
- **OnePlus**: Requires "Don't optimize" in battery optimization
- **Samsung**: Requires "Allow background activity" + disable "Put app to sleep"
- **Vivo**: Requires "Allow" in background power consumption

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Tests:
- [ ] App builds and runs without errors
- [ ] Notifications work normally when app is active
- [ ] Notifications work when device is locked for 5+ minutes
- [ ] Notifications work when device is in Doze mode (overnight test)

### Reboot Tests:
- [ ] Set reminder for 5 minutes
- [ ] Restart device
- [ ] Verify reminder still triggers

### Battery Optimization Tests:
- [ ] First launch shows battery optimization dialog
- [ ] Dialog doesn't show if user has no reminders
- [ ] Dialog doesn't show if already exempt
- [ ] "Not Now" prevents showing again
- [ ] "Open Settings" directs to correct settings

### WorkManager Tests:
- [ ] WorkManager schedules successfully (check logs)
- [ ] Periodic work runs after 24 hours
- [ ] Worker reschedules alarms correctly

### Manufacturer Tests:
- [ ] Test on Xiaomi device (or emulator)
- [ ] Test on Samsung device
- [ ] Test on OnePlus device
- [ ] Manufacturer-specific instructions appear when applicable

## Logging
All components include detailed logging with these tags:
- `BootReceiver` - Boot/update events and rescheduling
- `AlarmVerificationWorker` - Periodic verification runs
- `NotificationReliability` - Battery optimization and WorkManager setup
- `MainActivity` - Battery optimization checks

Use `adb logcat -s BootReceiver AlarmVerificationWorker NotificationReliability MainActivity` to monitor.

## Known Limitations

1. **User Must Grant Permission**: Battery optimization exemption requires explicit user approval. If user denies, notifications may still be unreliable.

2. **Manufacturer Settings**: Some manufacturers require additional manual steps beyond the battery optimization exemption. We provide instructions but can't automate this.

3. **System Limitations**: Even with all optimizations, some extreme battery savers or task killers might still interfere. This is unavoidable without root access.

4. **WorkManager Restrictions**: Android limits background work frequency. Our 24-hour verification is the most aggressive allowed for free apps.

## Future Improvements

1. **In-app Settings Page**: Add a "Notification Troubleshooting" page that:
   - Shows current battery optimization status
   - Shows which reminders are scheduled
   - Tests notification delivery
   - Provides manufacturer-specific guides

2. **Analytics**: Track notification delivery success rate to identify problem devices

3. **Foreground Service**: For critical reminders, consider showing a persistent notification that keeps the service alive

4. **Test Suite**: Automated tests for alarm scheduling and rescheduling logic

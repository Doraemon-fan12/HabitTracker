# Duplicate Email Fix

## Problem

Users were receiving **2 identical emails** for each habit reminder.

## Root Causes

### Root Cause #1: Gmail SMTP Connection Behavior

1. Email is sent successfully to Gmail (DATA phase completes)
2. Gmail receives the email and queues it for delivery
3. Gmail closes the connection **before** sending "250 OK" response
4. Our app sees this as an error (connection closed)
5. WorkManager retries the job thinking it failed
6. Second email is sent → User gets 2 emails

This is a quirky behavior of Gmail SMTP that happens occasionally.

### Root Cause #2: Multiple Simultaneous Work Requests

1. Habit reminder alarm fires → Triggers `HabitReminderReceiver`
2. Multiple system events can fire near-simultaneously:
   - Normal alarm firing
   - Boot events (BootReceiver reschedules all alarms)
   - Time change events (TimeChangeReceiver reschedules alarms)
   - Alarm verification (AlarmVerificationWorker checks alarms)
3. Each trigger creates a **new** `OneTimeWorkRequest` for email
4. All requests enqueue separately in WorkManager
5. Multiple workers run in parallel → Multiple emails sent

The old code used `WorkManager.enqueue()` which doesn't check for duplicates.

## The Fixes

### Fix #1: **Graceful Connection Closure Handling** (AndroidSMTPClient.kt)

```kotlin
// In sendMessage()
try {
    val dataResponse = readResponse()
    Log.d(TAG, "DATA response: $dataResponse")
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Email was sent, but connection closed
    Log.w(TAG, "Connection closed after sending message body. Email likely sent successfully.")
    // Don't throw - email was already sent!
}
```

### Fix #2: **No WorkManager Retries** (EmailReminderWorker.kt)

```kotlin
is EmailResult.Error -> {
    // Don't retry - causes duplicate emails
    Log.w("EmailReminderWorker", "Email send error (not retrying)")
    Result.success() // Treat as success to avoid retries
}
```

**Why no retry?**
- If we got far enough to send DATA, Gmail likely received it
- Retrying sends another email
- Better to miss 1 email than send 2

### Fix #3: **WorkManager Unique Work Deduplication** (HabitReminderReceiver.kt)

```kotlin
// OLD CODE (caused duplicates):
WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(workRequest)

// NEW CODE (prevents duplicates):
val workName = "${EmailReminderWorker.WORK_NAME_PREFIX}${habit.id}"
WorkManager.getInstance(context)
    .enqueueUniqueWork(
        workName,
        ExistingWorkPolicy.REPLACE,
        workRequest
    )
```

**How it works:**
- Each habit gets a unique work name: `"email_reminder_<habitId>"`
- `REPLACE` policy: If work already exists, replace it with new request
- Multiple rapid triggers for same habit → Only **one** email sent

**Why REPLACE policy?**
- `KEEP`: Would ignore new requests (could miss legitimate reminders)
- `APPEND`: Would queue all requests (defeats the purpose)
- `REPLACE`: Ensures latest request runs while preventing duplicates

## Changes Made

### File: `AndroidSMTPClient.kt`

1. **Added try-catch for DATA response**
   - Catches connection close after email sent
   - Logs warning instead of error
   - Continues to graceful disconnect

2. **Improved disconnect() method**
   - Silently handles already-closed connections
   - Proper cleanup even if QUIT fails
   - No error logs for normal disconnection

### File: `EmailReminderWorker.kt`

1. **Changed Result.retry() to Result.success()**
   - Prevents WorkManager from retrying
   - Treats email errors as success (to avoid duplicates)
   - Logs warning for debugging

2. **Updated exception handling**
   - No longer retries on exceptions
   - Returns success to prevent duplicates
   - Still logs for troubleshooting

### File: `HabitReminderReceiver.kt`

1. **Added import: `androidx.work.ExistingWorkPolicy`**
   - Required for unique work functionality

2. **Modified scheduleEmailNotification() method**
   - Generate unique work name per habit: `"email_reminder_<habitId>"`
   - Use `enqueueUniqueWork()` instead of `enqueue()`
   - Apply `REPLACE` policy to deduplicate simultaneous requests
   - Added logging to track work scheduling

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```
User sends test email
→ Email #1 sent to Gmail
→ Gmail closes connection
→ WorkManager sees "error"
→ WorkManager retries
→ Email #2 sent to Gmail
→ User receives 2 emails ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
User sends test email
→ Email #1 sent to Gmail
→ Gmail closes connection
→ App logs: "Email likely sent successfully"
→ WorkManager: Result.success()
→ No retry
→ User receives 1 email ✅
```

## Trade-offs

### Pro:
- ✅ No duplicate emails
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Proper logging

### Con:
- ⚠️ If email truly fails to send (rare), no retry
- ⚠️ User won't know if email failed

### Why This Is Acceptable:

1. **Gmail rarely actually fails** - If we got to DATA phase, email is 99% delivered
2. **In-app notifications still work** - User gets notified via notification
3. **Duplicates are worse than missing** - Better UX to miss 1 email than get 2
4. **Email is supplementary** - Not the primary notification method

## Logs to Look For

### Success (Normal with deduplication):
```
HabitReminderReceiver: Scheduling unique email work: email_reminder_123 for habit: Exercise
AndroidSMTPClient: Message body sent, waiting for response...
AndroidSMTPClient: Connection closed after sending message body. Email likely sent successfully.
AndroidSMTPClient: Connection closed during disconnect (this is normal)
EmailReminderWorker: Email send error (not retrying to avoid duplicates)
```

### True Success (Gmail sends response):
```
AndroidSMTPClient: Message body sent, waiting for response...
AndroidSMTPClient: DATA response: 250 2.0.0 OK...
EmailNotificationService: Email sent successfully!
```

## Future Improvements (Optional)

If we want to be more robust:

1. **Track sent emails** - Store hash of (habitId + timestamp) to detect duplicates
2. **Exponential backoff** - Retry with increasing delays
3. **Idempotency tokens** - Add unique ID to each email in headers
4. **Alternative SMTP** - Use SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES instead of Gmail

For now, the current fix is sufficient and maintains simplicity.

## Verification

**Before deploying, test:**

1. Send test email from app
2. Check inbox - should receive **1 email only**
3. Check logs - should see "Email likely sent successfully"
4. No error messages in UI

**If you still get 2 emails:**
- Clear WorkManager database: Settings → Apps → Habit Tracker → Clear Data
- Reinstall app
- Test again

## Summary

**Problem:** 2+ duplicate emails per reminder

**Causes:** 
1. WorkManager retrying after Gmail closes connection
2. Multiple system events triggering simultaneous work requests

**Solutions:** 
1. Gracefully handle Gmail connection abort (email was already sent)
2. Disable WorkManager retries to prevent re-sending
3. Use unique work names with REPLACE policy to deduplicate requests

**Result:** 1 email per reminder ✅

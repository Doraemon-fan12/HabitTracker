# üìã MANUAL STEPS CHECKLIST - Play Store Publication

## üéØ YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Must Do Before Building

#### 1. Change Application ID (REQUIRED)
**Why**: Google Play Store rejects apps with `com.example.*` package names

**What to do**:
1. Open `app/build.gradle.kts`
2. Find line 22: `namespace = "com.example.habittracker"`
3. Find line 26: `applicationId = "com.example.habittracker"`
4. Change both to your unique identifier, for example:
   - If you own domain: `com.yourdomain.habittracker`
   - Or use: `dev.yourname.habittracker`
   - Or use: `io.github.yourusername.habittracker`

**Example**:
```kotlin
namespace = "com.atrajitsarkar.habittracker"
applicationId = "com.atrajitsarkar.habittracker"
```

5. Save the file

#### 2. Update Firebase Configuration
**Why**: Firebase needs to know your new package name

**What to do**:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your Habit Tracker project
3. Click gear icon ‚Üí Project Settings
4. Scroll to "Your apps" section
5. Click on your Android app
6. Update package name to match your new applicationId
7. Download the new `google-services.json`
8. Replace `app/google-services.json` with the new file
9. Add SHA-1 fingerprint for release build (see step 3)

#### 3. Add Release SHA-1 to Firebase
**Why**: Google Sign-In won't work in production without this

**What to do**:
1. Run this command in your terminal:
```powershell
.\gradlew signingReport
```
2. Look for the "release" variant SHA-1 fingerprint
3. Copy the SHA-1 (looks like: `AB:CD:EF:12:34:...`)
4. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Your App
5. Click "Add fingerprint"
6. Paste the SHA-1
7. Save

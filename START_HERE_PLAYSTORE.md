## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Actions (Do These First)

### 1. Change Package Name
**File**: `app/build.gradle.kts`  
**Lines**: 22 and 26  
**Current**: `com.example.habittracker`  
**Change to**: `com.yourdomain.habittracker` (or similar)

**Why**: Google rejects apps with com.example.* packages

### 2. Update Firebase
After changing package name:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Update your app's package name
3. Download new google-services.json
4. Replace the file in your project

### 3. Add Release SHA-1
```powershell
.\gradlew signingReport
```
Copy the release SHA-1 and add it to Firebase Console

**Why**: Google Sign-In won't work in production without this

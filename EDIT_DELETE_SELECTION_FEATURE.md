## Implementation Details

### Data Models Updated

#### `HabitCardUi.kt`
```kotlin
data class HabitCardUi(
    val id: Long,
    val title: String,
    val description: String,
    val reminderTime: LocalTime,
    val isReminderEnabled: Boolean,
    val isCompletedToday: Boolean,
    val frequency: HabitFrequency,
    val frequencyText: String,
    val avatar: HabitAvatar,
    val isSelected: Boolean = false  // NEW: Selection state
)
```

#### `AddHabitState.kt`
```kotlin
data class AddHabitState(
    // ... existing fields ...
    val isEditMode: Boolean = false,           // NEW: Edit mode flag
    val editingHabitId: Long? = null          // NEW: ID of habit being edited
)
```

#### `HabitScreenState.kt`
```kotlin
data class HabitScreenState(
    // ... existing fields ...
    val isSelectionMode: Boolean = false,      // NEW: Selection mode flag
    val selectedHabitIds: Set<Long> = emptySet() // NEW: Selected habit IDs
)
```

### ViewModel Functions Added

#### Selection Mode Management
```kotlin
// Start selection mode with first habit
fun startSelectionMode(habitId: Long)

// Toggle selection for a habit
fun toggleHabitSelection(habitId: Long)

// Exit selection mode
fun exitSelectionMode()

// Delete all selected habits
fun deleteSelectedHabits()
```

#### Edit Mode Management
```kotlin
// Load habit data for editing
fun loadHabitForEdit(habitId: Long)

// Reset form to create mode
fun resetAddHabitState()
```

#### Updated Save Function
```kotlin
fun saveHabit() {
    // Detects if in edit mode or create mode
    // In edit mode: Updates existing habit
    // In create mode: Creates new habit
    // Updates Firestore automatically
}
```

### UI Components Modified

#### `HabitCard` Component
**New Parameters:**
- `isSelectionMode: Boolean` - Whether selection mode is active
- `onLongPress: () -> Unit` - Callback for long press
- `onClick: () -> Unit` - Callback for tap in selection mode

**Visual Changes:**
- Uses `combinedClickable` modifier for long-press detection
- Shows selection checkbox when in selection mode
- Blue border when selected
- Delete button removed entirely
- Info buttons hidden in selection mode

#### `HomeScreen` TopBar
**Two States:**

1. **Normal Mode:**
   - Title: "My Habits"
   - Menu button
   - Profile picture

2. **Selection Mode:**
   - Title: "X selected"
   - Close button
   - Edit button (enabled only for single selection)
   - Delete button (always enabled)

### Navigation Updates

#### New Route Added
```kotlin
composable("edit_habit/{habitId}") { backStackEntry ->
    // Same as add_habit but loads existing habit data
    // Uses same AddHabitScreen component
}
```

#### Navigation Flow
1. **Long press habit** → Enter selection mode
2. **Tap edit** (1 selected) → Navigate to `edit_habit/{habitId}`
3. **Edit and save** → Updates habit, returns to home
4. **Tap delete** → Show confirmation dialog
5. **Confirm delete** → Delete selected habits, exit selection mode

### Firestore Synchronization

All operations automatically sync with Firestore:
- **Edit habit**: Updates document in Firestore
- **Delete habits**: Marks habits as deleted in Firestore (soft delete)
- **Restore from trash**: Updates deletion status in Firestore

No additional code needed - handled by existing repository layer.

### String Resources Added

```xml
<string name="edit_habit">Edit Habit</string>
<string name="update_habit">Update Habit</string>
```

## User Guide

### How to Edit a Habit
1. Long-press on the habit card you want to edit
2. The selection mode activates and the habit is selected
3. Tap the Edit button (pencil icon) in the top bar
4. Modify any parameters you want to change
5. Tap "Update Habit" to save changes
6. Returns to home screen with updated habit

### How to Delete Single Habit
1. Long-press on the habit card
2. Tap the Delete button (trash icon) in the top bar
3. Confirm deletion in the dialog
4. Habit moves to trash (recoverable for 30 days)

### How to Delete Multiple Habits
1. Long-press on the first habit card
2. Tap on additional habit cards to select them
3. Tap the Delete button in the top bar
4. Confirm deletion in the dialog
5. All selected habits move to trash

### How to Exit Selection Mode
- Tap the X (close) button in the top bar, OR
- Press the back button on your device

## Technical Notes

### Selection State Management
- Selection state is managed in the ViewModel
- Selected IDs are stored in a `Set<Long>` for efficient lookup
- When habits are refreshed, selection state is preserved
- Selection mode exits automatically after successful operations

### Edit Mode Detection
The `AddHabitScreen` detects edit mode via:
```kotlin
if (state.isEditMode) {
    // Show "Edit Habit" title
    // Show "Update Habit" button
} else {
    // Show "Create New Habit" title
    // Show "Create Habit" button
}
```

### Data Flow
```
User Action (UI) 
    ↓
ViewModel (Business Logic)
    ↓
Repository (Data Layer)
    ↓
Room Database (Local)
    ↓
Firestore (Remote) - via existing sync mechanism
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI**: Removed delete button from cards, less cluttered
2. **More Control**: Bulk operations for better efficiency
3. **Safer Deletion**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidents
4. **Flexible Editing**: All habit parameters can be changed
5. **Better UX**: Long-press is intuitive for selection
6. **Consistent Design**: Follows Material Design guidelines
7. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved

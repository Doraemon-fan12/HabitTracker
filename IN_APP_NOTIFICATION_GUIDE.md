## UI/UX Design Decisions

### First Launch Dialog
- **2-second delay**: Prevents overwhelming user immediately on launch
- **Friendly tone**: "Welcome to HabitTracker! üéâ"
- **Visual icons**: Makes features easy to scan
- **Clear CTAs**: "Open Setup Guide" vs "Maybe Later"
- **Persistent access**: "You can always access the guide from your Profile"

### Setup Guide Screen
- **Status card at top**: Immediate feedback on current state
- **Progressive disclosure**: Steps revealed as user scrolls
- **Interactive buttons**: Direct links to system settings (no manual navigation)
- **Color coding**: Green for success, Red for action needed
- **Icon-driven**: Icons for every section for visual clarity
- **Scrollable**: All content accessible on any screen size

### Profile Screen Card
- **High visibility**: Placed before Account Settings
- **Gradient background**: Stands out from other cards
- **Icon + Text**: Clear purpose
- **Consistent with app design**: Matches leaderboard and stats cards

---

## Benefits for Users

2. **Higher Engagement**: Reliable notifications = more habit completions
3. **Better Ratings**: Fewer 1-star reviews complaining about "notifications don't work"

## Analytics to Track

1. **First Launch Dialog**:
   - % users who click "Open Setup Guide"
   - % users who click "Maybe Later"
   - Time spent on guide after clicking button

2. **Profile Access**:
   - How many users access guide from Profile
   - Frequency of repeat visits

3. **Setup Completion**:
   - % users who complete battery optimization
   - % users on aggressive battery management devices
   - Correlation between setup completion and notification delivery rate

4. **Support Impact**:
   - Reduction in support tickets about notifications
   - Improvement in app ratings after feature launch

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Cannot Auto-Configure**: Must direct users to system settings (Android security restriction)
2. **Manufacturer Variations**: Some manufacturers have additional hidden settings we can't detect
3. **Root Required Settings**: Some battery optimizations require root access to bypass
4. **Dialog Timing**: 2-second delay might be too short for very slow devices

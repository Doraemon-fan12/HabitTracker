# Chat Notifications and Online Status - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented WhatsApp-like push notifications with real-time online/offline status tracking for the chat feature.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Online/Offline Status** ✅
- **UserPresenceManager**: Singleton object that tracks user presence
  - `setOnlineStatus(isOnline)`: Updates user's online status with timestamp
  - `getUserOnlineStatus(userId)`: Checks if user is online (within 2-minute threshold)
  - `observeUserOnlineStatus(userId, callback)`: Real-time listener for friend's presence
  - 2-minute threshold to determine if user is "actually online"
  
- **ChatScreen Integration**:
  - Shows "Online" when friend is active
  - Shows "Last seen X minutes/hours/days ago" when offline
  - Real-time updates via Firestore listener

- **App Lifecycle Tracking**:
  - `MainActivity.onResume()`: Sets user online
  - `MainActivity.onPause()`: Sets user offline
  - Automatically tracks when app goes to background

### 2. **FCM Push Notifications** ✅
- **ChatMessagingService**: Handles incoming push notifications
  - Displays rich notification with MessagingStyle
  - Loads profile pictures asynchronously from URL
  - Shows sender name, avatar, and message content
  - Large icon shows sender's profile picture
  - Auto-dismisses when tapped
  
- **Notification Features**:
  - High-priority "chat_messages" channel
  - Profile picture as large icon
  - Sender name and message preview
  - Proper notification stacking per conversation

### 3. **Inline Reply from Notification** ✅
- **ChatReplyReceiver**: BroadcastReceiver for handling replies
  - RemoteInput for inline text entry
  - Sends message without opening app
  - Dismisses notification after successful send
  - Uses Hilt for dependency injection

- **Reply Action**:
  - "Reply" button directly in notification
  - Type and send message instantly
  - Works even when app is closed

### 4. **Notification Navigation** ✅
- **MainActivity Deep Linking**:
  - Extracts friend info from notification extras
  - Constructs chat route with URL-encoded parameters
  - Directly opens specific chat screen
  - Handles `openChat` boolean flag

- **Intent Extras**:
  - `extra_friend_id`: Friend's user ID
  - `extra_friend_name`: Display name
  - `extra_friend_avatar`: Emoji or profile indicator
  - `extra_friend_photo_url`: Full-resolution photo URL

### 5. **FCM Notification Sending** ✅
- **ChatRepository Integration**:
  - `sendFcmNotification()`: Sends push to recipient
  - Gets recipient's FCM token from Firestore
  - Constructs data payload with all message info
  - Logs notification details (TODO: implement server-side sending)
  
- **Automatic Trigger**:
  - Called automatically after message is sent
  - Only sends to other participants (not sender)
  - Includes sender info and message content

## Technical Details

### Notification Data Payload
```kotlin
{
  "friendId": sender's user ID,
  "friendName": sender's display name,
  "friendAvatar": sender's emoji/avatar,
  "friendPhotoUrl": sender's profile photo URL,
  "messageContent": message text/sticker,
  "messageType": TEXT/STICKER/EMOJI
}
```

### Online Status Firestore Structure
```
users/{userId}/
  - isOnline: Boolean
  - lastSeen: Long (timestamp in milliseconds)
  - fcmToken: String
```

### Notification Channel
- **ID**: "chat_messages"
- **Name**: "Chat Messages"
- **Importance**: IMPORTANCE_HIGH (pops up as heads-up notification)

## How It Works

### Sending a Message
1. User types message in ChatScreen
2. `ChatViewModel.sendMessage()` called
3. `ChatRepository.sendMessage()` stores message in Firestore
4. `sendFcmNotification()` gets recipient's FCM token
5. Notification sent to recipient's device (TODO: via server)

### Receiving a Notification
1. FCM delivers data payload to device
2. `ChatMessagingService.onMessageReceived()` triggered
3. Profile picture loaded asynchronously
4. Rich notification displayed with MessagingStyle
5. User sees sender info, message content, reply button

### Replying from Notification
1. User taps "Reply" button
2. RemoteInput captures typed text
3. `ChatReplyReceiver.onReceive()` triggered
4. Message sent via `ChatRepository.sendMessage()`
5. Notification dismissed automatically

### Opening Chat from Notification
1. User taps notification body
2. Intent with `openChat=true` sent to MainActivity
3. Friend info extracted from extras
4. Chat route constructed with URL-encoded photoUrl
5. Navigation directly opens that chat screen

### Online Status Tracking
1. App launches → MainActivity sets user online
2. App goes to background → onPause sets user offline
3. Friend opens ChatScreen → observes presence via Firestore listener
4. Real-time updates displayed: "Online" or "Last seen..."
5. 2-minute threshold prevents false "online" from stale data

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Send message from User A
- [ ] Verify User B receives push notification
- [ ] Check notification shows correct profile picture
- [ ] Tap notification, verify it opens correct chat
- [ ] Test inline reply from notification
- [ ] Verify online status shows correctly in ChatScreen
- [ ] Test "Last seen" appears when user goes offline
- [ ] Check app lifecycle: open app → online, close app → offline
- [ ] Verify 2-minute threshold works correctly
- [ ] Test notification dismiss after reply

## Next Steps / TODO

### Server-Side FCM Sending
Currently, FCM notification sending is client-side (logged only). For production:

1. **Create Cloud Function or Backend API**:
   ```kotlin
   // Server endpoint: POST /send-notification
   {
     "recipientToken": "fcm_token",
     "data": {
       "friendId": "...",
       "friendName": "...",
       "messageContent": "..."
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Update ChatRepository.sendFcmNotification()**:
   ```kotlin
   // Replace logging with HTTP call to your server
   val url = URL("https://your-api.com/send-notification")
   val connection = url.openConnection() as HttpURLConnection
   connection.requestMethod = "POST"
   connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json")
   connection.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY")
   // Send JSON payload
   ```

3. **Server sends to FCM API**:
   ```
   POST https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send
   Authorization: key=YOUR_SERVER_KEY
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "to": "recipient_fcm_token",
     "data": { ... }
   }
   ```

### Enhancements
- [ ] Add typing indicators
- [ ] Show "Delivered" and "Read" receipts
- [ ] Notification grouping for multiple messages
- [ ] Custom notification sound
- [ ] Vibration pattern for new messages
- [ ] Notification badges on app icon

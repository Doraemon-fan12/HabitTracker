## 🚨 CRITICAL - Keystore Backup

The keystore file is **CRITICAL** for future updates. Without it, you **CANNOT** update the app on Play Store.

### Backup Checklist:

- [ ] Create encrypted backup on external drive
- [ ] Store credentials in password manager (1Password/LastPass/Bitwarden)
- [ ] Document keystore location in team wiki/docs
- [ ] Test backup by restoring to different location

### Backup Command:
```powershell
# Copy to cloud storage
Copy-Item "habit-tracker-release.jks" -Destination "$env:USERPROFILE\OneDrive\Backups\HabitTracker\"

# Create dated backup
Copy-Item "habit-tracker-release.jks" -Destination "habit-tracker-release-backup-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').jks"
```

## 🛡️ Protection Layers

| Layer | Purpose | When It Helps |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Battery Exemption** | Prevents system from killing app | Doze mode, idle |
| **Boot Receiver** | Reschedules after reboot | Device restart |
| **WorkManager** | Verifies alarms daily | Silent alarm cancellation |
| **Manufacturer Guide** | Device-specific settings | Aggressive battery managers |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Build & Run
```bash
# Stop existing Gradle daemons
.\gradlew --stop

# Clean build
.\gradlew clean build

# Install on device
.\gradlew installDebug
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
# Check if BootReceiver is registered
adb shell dumpsys package com.example.habittracker | grep BootReceiver

# Check battery optimization status
adb shell dumpsys power | grep habittracker

# Watch logs
adb logcat -s BootReceiver AlarmVerificationWorker NotificationReliability
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Essential Tests
- [ ] **Basic Test**: Set reminder for 5 min, lock device, wait
- [ ] **Reboot Test**: Set reminder, reboot device, verify alarm survives
- [ ] **Doze Test**: Set reminder for 8 hours, leave device idle overnight
- [ ] **Dialog Test**: Fresh install shows battery optimization prompt

### Device-Specific Tests  
- [ ] Test on Xiaomi device
- [ ] Test on Samsung device
- [ ] Test on OnePlus device
- [ ] Test on stock Android

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Key Logs
```bash
# All notification logs
adb logcat -s BootReceiver AlarmVerificationWorker NotificationReliability HabitReminderScheduler

# Only errors
adb logcat *:E | grep habittracker
```

### Success Indicators
✅ `BootReceiver: Successfully rescheduled X reminders`  
✅ `AlarmVerificationWorker: Alarm verification complete`  
✅ `NotificationReliability: Alarm verification work scheduled successfully`  
✅ Notifications appear within 30 seconds of scheduled time  

### Failure Indicators
❌ No logs after device reboot  
❌ `Error rescheduling reminders`  
❌ Notifications delayed > 5 minutes  
❌ App crashes on boot  

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### First Launch (User Has Reminders)
1. App opens normally
2. After 1.5 seconds, dialog appears
3. Dialog explains battery optimization
4. User can choose "Open Settings" or "Not Now"
5. If on Xiaomi/Samsung/etc, shows manufacturer instructions

### After Device Reboot
1. Device boots up
2. BootReceiver triggers automatically
3. Retrieves all habits with reminders
4. Reschedules each alarm
5. Logs success count
6. Alarms trigger at correct times

### Daily (WorkManager)
1. Every 24 hours, AlarmVerificationWorker runs
2. Retrieves all habits with reminders
3. Reschedules all alarms (as backup)
4. Logs verification complete
5. Ensures no alarms were silently cancelled

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Notifications not appearing"
1. Check battery optimization: `adb shell dumpsys power | grep habittracker`
2. Check alarms scheduled: `adb shell dumpsys alarm | grep habittracker`
3. Manually grant exemption: Settings → Battery → Battery optimization → HabitTracker → Don't optimize

### "Alarms disappear after reboot"
1. Check BootReceiver logs: `adb logcat -s BootReceiver`
2. Manually trigger: `adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED`
3. Verify permission: RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED in manifest

### "WorkManager not running"
1. Check if scheduled: `adb shell dumpsys jobscheduler | grep habittracker`
2. Check Hilt setup in HabitTrackerApp.kt
3. Verify dependency: androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx in build.gradle

## 📱 Device-Specific Notes

### Xiaomi
- Requires "Autostart" permission
- Go to: Security → Permissions → Autostart → Enable HabitTracker

### Samsung
- May have "Put app to sleep" feature
- Go to: Settings → Battery → Background usage limits → Never sleeping apps

### OnePlus
- Has "Optimized battery usage"
- Go to: Settings → Battery → Battery optimization → Don't optimize

### Oppo/Realme
- Requires "Allow background activity"
- Go to: Settings → Battery → HabitTracker → Allow background activity

---

## 📊 Performance Impact

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|---------------|
| Battery Usage | < 1% per day |
| Memory | ~50MB (normal for compose app) |
| Storage | ~30MB |
| Network | 0 (notifications are local) |
| CPU | Negligible (only brief wakeups) |

---

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Permissions Added
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

### Dependencies Added
```kotlin
implementation(libs.androidx.work.runtime.ktx) // WorkManager
implementation(libs.androidx.hilt.work)        // Hilt + WorkManager
kapt(libs.androidx.hilt.compiler)              // Hilt compiler for WorkManager
```

### Architecture
```
AlarmManager (Primary)
    ↓ (if fails)
WorkManager (Backup - 24h verification)
    ↓ (if reboot)
BootReceiver (Reschedule all)
    ↓ (if battery kills app)
Battery Optimization Exemption (Prevent killing)
```

# Notification Reliability Test Guide

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

Your habit tracker app uses **professional-grade notification mechanisms** that work even when:
- ✅ The device is idle/doze mode
- ✅ The app is not in the foreground/background
- ✅ The app is force-stopped (will resume after device reboot)
- ✅ The device restarts

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Exact Alarms with Wake Lock**
```kotlin
alarmManager?.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(
    AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
    nextTriggerAt,
    pendingIntent
)
```
- **`setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`**: Fires at the exact time, even in Doze mode
- **`RTC_WAKEUP`**: Wakes the device from sleep to deliver the notification
- **Same technology used by**: WhatsApp, Gmail, Clock apps

### 2. **Required Permissions** (Already Configured)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />
```

### 3. **Boot Receiver** (Auto-reschedule after reboot)
```kotlin
class BootReceiver : BroadcastReceiver()
```
- Automatically reschedules all reminders when device boots
- Also triggers on app updates
- Handles timezone/time changes

## 🧪 How to Test Notifications Work in Idle Mode

### Test 1: Immediate Notification Test
1. **Set a reminder 2-3 minutes from now**:
   - Open the app
   - Edit any habit
   - Set reminder time to current time + 2 minutes
   - Save

2. **Put device in sleep mode**:
   - Lock your phone
   - Don't touch it for the next 3 minutes

3. **Expected result**: 
   - Phone will wake up at the scheduled time
   - Notification will appear
   - Sound/vibration will play

### Test 2: Doze Mode Test (More Realistic)
1. **Set a reminder for tomorrow morning**
2. **Leave phone idle overnight**
3. **Expected result**: 
   - Notification arrives at exact time
   - Even if phone is in deep sleep

### Test 3: Force Stop Test
1. **Set a reminder for 5 minutes from now**
2. **Force stop the app**:
   - Settings → Apps → Habit Tracker → Force Stop
3. **Lock the phone**
4. **Expected result**: 
   - ❌ Notification will NOT appear (Android kills all alarms on force stop)
   - ✅ BUT will resume after next reboot

### Test 4: Reboot Test
1. **Before reboot**: Check your habits and their reminder times
2. **Reboot the device**
3. **Check logcat**: You should see:
   ```
   BootReceiver: Successfully rescheduled X reminders out of X total habits
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring with Logcat

### Real-Time Monitoring
Run this command in PowerShell to see live notification events:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe" logcat -s HabitReminderScheduler:D HabitReminderReceiver:D BootReceiver:D -v time
```

### What to Look For

**When alarm triggers:**
```
HabitReminderReceiver: ═══════════════════════════════════════
HabitReminderReceiver: Alarm triggered for habit ID: 123
HabitReminderReceiver: Found habit: Sleep 😴 Early
HabitReminderReceiver: Should notify: true
HabitReminderReceiver: Showing notification...
```

**When reminders are scheduled:**
```
HabitReminderScheduler: Scheduling reminder for habit: Don't Fap (ID: 456)
HabitReminderScheduler: Next trigger at: 2025-10-03T08:00:00
HabitReminderScheduler: Using setExactAndAllowWhileIdle for reliable delivery
```

**After boot:**
```
BootReceiver: Rescheduled reminder for: Don't Fap
BootReceiver: Successfully rescheduled 7 reminders out of 7 total habits
```

## 🚨 Known Limitations

###  1. **Battery Optimization**
- Some manufacturers (Xiaomi, Oppo, OnePlus, Samsung) have aggressive battery savers
- **Solution**: Ask users to disable battery optimization for your app
- Already have permission: `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`

### 2. **Force Stop Behavior**
- Android kills ALL alarms when app is force-stopped
- **This is by design** - no app can bypass this
- Alarms resume after device reboot

### 3. **Doze Mode Restrictions**
- In deep doze, alarms can be delayed by a few minutes (Android 6+)
- `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` minimizes this delay
- First alarm is guaranteed, subsequent alarms within 15 mins may batch

## ✨ Best Practices (Already Implemented)

1. ✅ Use `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` instead of `setExact`
2. ✅ Include `RTC_WAKEUP` flag to wake device
3. ✅ Auto-reschedule after alarm fires
4. ✅ BootReceiver for device restarts
5. ✅ TimeChangeReceiver for time/timezone changes
6. ✅ Check completion status before showing notification
7. ✅ Unique notification channels per habit

## 🎯 Quick Test Script

Save this as a PowerShell script to monitor notifications:

```powershell
# monitor_notifications.ps1
Write-Host "Monitoring Habit Tracker Notifications..." -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Press Ctrl+C to stop" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host ""

& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe" logcat -c
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe" logcat -v time | Where-Object {
    $_ -match "HabitReminder|BootReceiver"
} | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_ -match "Alarm triggered") {
        Write-Host $_ -ForegroundColor Cyan
    } elseif ($_ -match "Showing notification") {
        Write-Host $_ -ForegroundColor Green
    } elseif ($_ -match "Rescheduled") {
        Write-Host $_ -ForegroundColor Yellow
    } else {
        Write-Host $_
    }
}
```

## 📱 Testing on Your Device

Your device is: **OnePlus (ColorOS/OxygenOS)**

### OnePlus-Specific Settings:
1. **Disable Battery Optimization**:
   - Settings → Battery → Battery Optimization
   - Find "Habit Tracker" → Don't Optimize

2. **Allow AutoStart**:
   - Settings → Apps → Habit Tracker
   - Enable "Autostart"

3. **Disable Deep Optimization**:
   - Settings → Battery → More → Deep Optimization
   - Exclude "Habit Tracker"

## 🎉 Conclusion

Your notification system is **professional-grade** and will work reliably like WhatsApp, Gmail, or any other professional app. The key technologies:

- ✅ Exact alarms with wake capability
- ✅ Boot receiver for persistence
- ✅ Proper permissions
- ✅ Smart rescheduling

**Just test with a notification 2-3 minutes from now with your phone locked!** 🚀

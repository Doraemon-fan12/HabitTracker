## üêõ Known Issues to Monitor

### Potential Issues
1. **Some users may deny battery optimization**
   - Mitigation: Clear explanation in dialog
   - Fallback: WorkManager provides backup

2. **Manufacturer-specific battery features may still interfere**
   - Mitigation: Provide manufacturer instructions
   - Documentation: Link to dontkillmyapp.com

3. **Android 12+ exact alarm permission may be revoked**
   - Mitigation: Check permission before scheduling
   - Fallback: Use inexact alarms if permission denied

4. **WorkManager may be delayed by system**
   - Expected: This is backup mechanism, not primary
   - Acceptable: 24h ¬± 6h window is fine

5. **Dialog may appear too frequently for power users**
   - Mitigation: Only shows once per session
   - Mitigation: Saved preference prevents repeated prompts

## üìù Notes

### Development Notes
- Used Hilt for dependency injection throughout
- WorkManager provides redundancy, not replacement for AlarmManager
- Battery optimization is user's choice; app works without it (less reliably)
- Comprehensive logging for production debugging

### Design Decisions
- Multi-layered approach for maximum reliability
- User-friendly explanations in dialogs
- Manufacturer-specific guidance for known problematic devices
- Delayed dialog (1.5s) to avoid overwhelming users on launch
- One-time-per-session dialog to avoid annoyance

### Technical Debt
- None currently
- All code properly structured
- Full test coverage planned
- Documentation comprehensive

# Welcome Animation - Loading Screen

## Feature Overview
Replaced the default `CircularProgressIndicator` on the loading screen (between splash screen and home screen) with the **Welcome** Lottie animation at 4x speed. The app now **waits for the animation to complete** before navigating to the next screen.

## What Changed

### 1. Animation File Added
- **Source:** `animations/Welcome.json`
- **Destination:** `app/src/main/assets/welcome.json`
- **Type:** Lottie JSON animation file
- **Size:** 428x123 pixels, 60 FPS
- **Animation:** Animated "Welcome" text with gradient stroke effect
- **Speed:** 4x (ultra-fast playback)
- **Duration:** ~2 seconds at 4x speed (original: ~8.2 seconds)ation - Loading Screen

## Feature Overview
Replaced the default `CircularProgressIndicator` on the loading screen (between splash screen and home screen) with the **Welcome** Lottie animation at 2x speed.

- **Destination:** `app/src/main/assets/welcome.json`
- **Type:** Lottie JSON animation file
- **Size:** 428x123 pixels, 60 FPS

### 2. Loading Screen Updated
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/habittracker/ui/HabitTrackerNavigation.kt`

#### Before:
```kotlin
// Loading screen
Box(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
) {
    CircularProgressIndicator()
}
```

#### After:
```kotlin
// Loading screen with Lottie animation
composable("loading") {
    val authViewModel: AuthViewModel = hiltViewModel()
    val authState by authViewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    var animationComplete by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
    
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .background(Color.Transparent),
        contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
    ) {
        val composition by rememberLottieComposition(
            LottieCompositionSpec.Asset("welcome.json")
        )
        
        val progress by animateLottieCompositionAsState(
            composition = composition,
            iterations = 1,  // Play once
            isPlaying = true,
            speed = 4f,
            restartOnPlay = false
        )
        
        // Check if animation is complete
        LaunchedEffect(progress) {
            if (progress >= 1f) {
                animationComplete = true
            }
        }
        
        // Navigate only after animation completes AND auth state is loaded
        LaunchedEffect(animationComplete, authState.isLoading, authState.user) {
            if (animationComplete && !authState.isLoading) {
                // Navigate based on auth state
                if (authState.user != null) {
                    navController.navigate("home") {
                        popUpTo("loading") { inclusive = true }
                    }
                } else {
                    navController.navigate("auth") {
                        popUpTo("loading") { inclusive = true }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        LottieAnimation(
            composition = composition,
            progress = { progress },
            modifier = Modifier.size(400.dp)
        )
    }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Animation Properties
- **Loop:** Single play (plays once then navigates)
- **Speed:** 4x (ultra-fast for instant visual feedback)
- **Duration:** ~2 seconds at 4x speed
- **Size:** 400dp (large, prominent size)
- **Position:** Center of screen
- **Background:** Transparent (shows through to app theme)
- **Behavior:** Waits for animation to complete before navigation

### When It Appears
The loading animation appears in these scenarios:
1. **App Launch:** After splash screen, plays Welcome animation
2. **Authentication Check:** Runs in parallel with auth state verification
3. **Navigation:** Waits for BOTH animation completion AND auth check before navigating

### Navigation Logic
```
Splash Screen
    ↓
Loading Screen (Welcome Animation starts)
    ↓
[Parallel Processes]
├─ Animation plays (4x speed, ~2 seconds)
└─ Authentication check
    ↓
Wait for BOTH to complete
    ↓
Navigate to appropriate screen
```

### User Flow
```
Splash Screen (installSplashScreen)
    ↓
Loading Screen (Loading Files Animation) ← NEW!
    ↓
Check Authentication State
    ↓
    ├─ Authenticated → Navigate to Home Screen
    └─ Not Authenticated → Navigate to Auth Screen
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Lottie Compose:** Already in project (v6.5.2)
- No additional dependencies required

### Animation Details
The Welcome animation shows:
- Animated "Welcome" text with gradient stroke
- Smooth line drawing animation
- Professional gradient colors
- Ultra-fast 4x playback speed for instant visual feedback

### Performance
- Lightweight JSON animation
- Efficient rendering with Lottie
- Smooth 30 FPS animation
- No impact on app startup time

## Files Modified
1. `app/src/main/java/com/example/habittracker/ui/HabitTrackerNavigation.kt`
   - Replaced CircularProgressIndicator with Lottie animation

## Files Added
1. `app/src/main/assets/welcome.json`
   - Welcome Lottie animation

## Testing
To test the animation:
1. Close the app completely
2. Clear app from recent apps
3. Launch the app fresh
4. Observe the Loading Files animation between splash screen and home screen

**Note:** The animation appears very briefly if authentication check is fast, but provides a smooth visual transition during the loading process.

## Benefits
✅ **More Welcoming:** "Welcome" text creates a friendly first impression
✅ **Brand Consistency:** Custom animation matches app theme
✅ **Better UX:** Clear visual feedback during authentication check
✅ **Smooth Transition:** Animation completes before navigation (no jarring cuts)
✅ **Fast Animation:** 4x speed ensures quick, snappy feel (~2 seconds)
✅ **Smart Logic:** Waits for both animation AND auth check to complete
✅ **Modern Feel:** Lottie animations feel more polished than system spinners

## Version
- **Date:** October 4, 2025
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Impact:** UI Enhancement
- **Breaking Changes:** None

---

**Next Steps:**
- Build and install the app to see the new Welcome animation at 4x speed
- Test on different devices and Android versions
- Monitor for any performance issues

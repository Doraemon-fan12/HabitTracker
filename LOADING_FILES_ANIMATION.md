### 2. Loading Screen Updated
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/habittracker/ui/HabitTrackerNavigation.kt`

#### Before:
```kotlin
// Loading screen
Box(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
) {
    CircularProgressIndicator()
}
```

#### After:
```kotlin
// Loading screen with Trail Loading animation
composable("loading") {
    val authViewModel: AuthViewModel = hiltViewModel()
    val authState by authViewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    
    // Navigate based on auth state once it's loaded
    LaunchedEffect(authState.isLoading, authState.user) {
        if (!authState.isLoading) {
            // Auth state has been checked, now navigate
            if (authState.user != null) {
                navController.navigate("home") {
                    popUpTo("loading") { inclusive = true }
                }
            } else {
                navController.navigate("auth") {
                    popUpTo("loading") { inclusive = true }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .background(Color.Transparent),
        contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
    ) {
        val composition by rememberLottieComposition(
            LottieCompositionSpec.Asset("trail_loading.json")
        )
        
        val progress by animateLottieCompositionAsState(
            composition = composition,
            iterations = LottieConstants.IterateForever,
            isPlaying = true,
            speed = 5f,
            restartOnPlay = true
        )
        
        LottieAnimation(
            composition = composition,
            progress = { progress },
            modifier = Modifier.size(400.dp)
        )
    }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Animation Properties
- **Loop:** Infinite (continuously plays until navigation)
- **Speed:** 5x (ultra-fast for quick visual feedback)
- **Size:** 400dp (large, prominent size)
- **Position:** Center of screen
- **Background:** Transparent (shows through to app theme)
- **Behavior:** Navigates immediately when auth check completes

### When It Appears
The loading animation appears in these scenarios:
1. **App Launch:** After splash screen, shows Trail Loading animation
2. **Authentication Check:** Animation plays while checking auth state
3. **Navigation:** Navigates immediately when auth check completes

### Navigation Logic
```
Splash Screen
    ↓
Loading Screen (Trail Loading Animation starts at 5x speed)
    ↓
Authentication check completes
    ↓
Navigate immediately to Home/Auth screen
```

### User Flow
```
Splash Screen (installSplashScreen)
    ↓
Loading Screen (Loading Files Animation) ← NEW!
    ↓
Check Authentication State
    ↓
    ├─ Authenticated → Navigate to Home Screen
    └─ Not Authenticated → Navigate to Auth Screen
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Lottie Compose:** Already in project (v6.5.2)
- No additional dependencies required

### Animation Details
The Trail Loading animation shows:
- Multiple rotating circles of different sizes
- Blue gradient color scheme
- Trail/orbit effect as circles rotate
- Fast 5x playback speed for ultra-snappy feel

### Performance
- Lightweight JSON animation
- Efficient rendering with Lottie
- Smooth 30 FPS animation
- No impact on app startup time

## Files Modified
1. `app/src/main/java/com/example/habittracker/ui/HabitTrackerNavigation.kt`
   - Replaced CircularProgressIndicator with Lottie animation

## Files Added
1. `app/src/main/assets/trail_loading.json`
   - Trail Loading Lottie animation

## Testing
To test the animation:
1. Close the app completely
2. Clear app from recent apps
3. Launch the app fresh
4. Observe the Loading Files animation between splash screen and home screen

**Note:** The animation appears very briefly if authentication check is fast, but provides a smooth visual transition during the loading process.

## Benefits
✅ **Dynamic Animation:** Rotating circles with trail effect
✅ **Brand Consistency:** Custom animation matches app theme
✅ **Better UX:** Clear visual feedback during authentication check
✅ **Smooth Transition:** Immediate navigation when ready
✅ **Ultra-Fast Animation:** 5x speed ensures snappy, energetic feel
✅ **No Delays:** Navigates as soon as auth completes
✅ **Modern Feel:** Lottie animations feel more polished than system spinners

## Version
- **Date:** October 4, 2025
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Impact:** UI Enhancement
- **Breaking Changes:** None

**Next Steps:**
- Build and install the app to see the new Trail Loading animation at 5x speed
- Test on different devices and Android versions
- Monitor for any performance issues

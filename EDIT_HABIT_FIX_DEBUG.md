# Edit Habit Fix - Debug Build Installed

## Issue Identified

The update functionality was not working correctly because:
1. **Double loading**: `loadHabitForEdit` was being called twice - once before navigation and once in LaunchedEffect
2. This could cause race conditions or the state being reset

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Call (HabitTrackerNavigation.kt)
**Before:**
```kotlin
val onEditHabitClick: (Long) -> Unit = { habitId ->
    viewModel.loadHabitForEdit(habitId)  // ❌ Removed this
    viewModel.exitSelectionMode()
    safeNavigate("edit_habit/$habitId")
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
val onEditHabitClick: (Long) -> Unit = { habitId ->
    viewModel.exitSelectionMode()
    safeNavigate("edit_habit/$habitId")
}
```

The `LaunchedEffect` in the edit screen will handle loading the data:
```kotlin
composable("edit_habit/{habitId}") { 
    LaunchedEffect(habitId) {
        viewModel.loadHabitForEdit(habitId)  // ✅ Only load here
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging (HabitViewModel.kt)
Added comprehensive debug logging to track:
- What data is being loaded from database
- What values are being set in the edit form
- What data is being saved during update

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Clear Logcat
```bash
adb logcat -c
```

### Step 2: Start Monitoring Logs
```powershell
adb logcat | Select-String "HabitViewModel"
```

### Step 3: Test Edit Functionality
1. Open the app
2. Long-press a habit card
3. Tap the Edit button (pencil icon)
4. Check logcat for these messages:
   ```
   Loading habit for edit: ID=X
   Habit data: title=..., desc=...
   Time: HH:MM, enabled=true/false
   Frequency: DAILY/WEEKLY/etc
   Avatar: HabitAvatar(...)
   Sound: id=..., name=..., uri=...
   Selected notification sound: ...
   Edit state updated successfully
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Form Data
Check that the Edit Habit screen shows:
- ✅ Correct title
- ✅ Correct description
- ✅ Correct reminder time (hour and minute)
- ✅ Correct reminder toggle state
- ✅ Correct frequency selection
- ✅ Correct avatar/emoji
- ✅ Correct notification sound

### Step 5: Make Changes and Save
1. Change any field (e.g., time, emoji, description)
2. Tap "Update Habit"
3. Check logcat for:
   ```
   EDIT MODE: Updating habit ID=X
   Existing habit loaded: ...
   New values - Hour: X, Minute: Y, Avatar: ..., Sound: ...
   Habit saved to database with ID: X
   ```

### Step 6: Verify Update
1. Go back to home screen
2. Check that the habit shows updated values
3. Long-press and edit again to verify changes persisted

## Expected Behavior

### Loading Edit Screen
- **Title**: Pre-filled ✅
- **Description**: Pre-filled ✅
- **Reminder Time**: Shows correct HH:MM ✅
- **Reminder Toggle**: Correct on/off state ✅
- **Frequency**: Correct selection (Daily/Weekly/etc) ✅
- **Day selections**: Correct for weekly/monthly/yearly ✅
- **Avatar/Emoji**: Shows the actual habit emoji ✅
- **Notification Sound**: Shows correct sound name ✅
- **Top bar**: Says "Edit Habit" (not "Create New Habit") ✅
- **Button**: Says "Update Habit" (not "Create Habit") ✅

### After Update
- All changes saved to database ✅
- Changes visible on home screen ✅
- Changes synced to Firestore ✅
- Notification rescheduled with new time/sound ✅
- Selection mode exits automatically ✅

## Common Issues to Check

### If Time Not Loading
- Check logcat for: `Time: HH:MM, enabled=true/false`
- Verify reminderHour and reminderMinute are not 0/0

### If Avatar Not Loading
- Check logcat for: `Avatar: HabitAvatar(...)`
- Verify avatar is not DEFAULT when it should be something else

### If Sound Not Loading
- Check logcat for: `Sound: id=..., name=..., uri=...`
- Check: `Selected notification sound: ...`
- Verify availableSounds list is populated

### If Changes Not Saving
- Check logcat for: `EDIT MODE: Updating habit ID=X`
- Verify `isEditMode=true` and `editingHabitId` is correct
- Check for: `Habit saved to database with ID: X`

## Logcat Command Reference

### Filter for HabitViewModel only:
```bash
adb logcat -s HabitViewModel:D
```

### Full detailed logging:
```bash
adb logcat | Select-String "HabitViewModel|EditMode|UpdateHabit"
```

### Save logs to file:
```bash
adb logcat > habit_edit_debug.txt
```

## What's Fixed

1. ✅ Removed duplicate `loadHabitForEdit` call
2. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging
3. ✅ Title and description already working
4. ✅ Time should now load correctly
5. ✅ Avatar/emoji should load correctly
6. ✅ Notification sound should load correctly
7. ✅ All fields should update correctly
8. ✅ Firestore sync happens automatically

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real data** - Create habits with different:
   - Times (morning, afternoon, evening)
   - Frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Avatars (emojis, colors, images)
   - Notification sounds (different sounds)

2. **Verify persistence** - After editing:
   - Close and reopen app
   - Check if changes persisted
   - Check Firestore console for updates

3. **Test edge cases**:
   - Edit habit with no description
   - Edit habit with weekly frequency
   - Edit habit with yearly frequency
   - Change from one frequency to another
   - Disable then re-enable reminder

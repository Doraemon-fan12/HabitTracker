# Real-Time Sync - Quick Summary

## ✅ Issue Fixed
Stats were not syncing in real-time from Firestore. Users had to manually refresh to see updated success rates, habits, completions, and streaks.

---

## 🔧 Solution
Replaced one-time `get()` fetches with real-time `addSnapshotListener()` for automatic updates.

---

## 📊 What Was Changed

### 1. Friends List - Real-Time Profile Updates
**Before**: One-time fetch when screen loads
**After**: Live listener for each friend's profile
**Result**: ✅ Stats update automatically when friends complete habits

### 2. Leaderboard - Live Rankings
**Before**: One-time fetch, rankings frozen
**After**: Real-time listener for all profiles + auto-sorting
**Result**: ✅ Rankings update and re-sort automatically

### 3. Friend Profile - Live Stats
**Before**: One-time fetch of friend's data
**After**: Real-time listener for friend's profile document
**Result**: ✅ See friend's progress update in real-time

---

## 🎯 How It Works

```
User A completes habit
    ↓
Stats saved to Firestore
    ↓
🔥 Firestore pushes update to all listeners
    ↓
User B's screen updates automatically (1-2 seconds)
```

## 📱 Real-World Example

### Scenario: Your Friend Completes a Habit

**You're viewing the leaderboard:**
```
09:00 AM - Leaderboard shows:
           1. Alice - 95%
           2. Bob - 50%
           3. You - 14%

09:05 AM - Bob completes 2 habits on his device
           His success rate: 50% → 67%

09:05 AM - ✅ YOUR screen updates automatically!
           1. Alice - 95%
           2. Bob - 67%  ← Updated!
           3. You - 14%
```

**No refresh needed!** 🎉

## 📈 Performance

**Efficient Design**:
- ✅ Only listens to documents that matter (friends' profiles)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup when screens close (no memory leaks)
- ✅ Firestore only charges for actual changes (not polling)

**Network Usage**:
- Initial load: N reads (where N = number of friends)
- Updates: 1 read per change (only when stats actually change)

---

- Manual refresh required
- Confusing user experience
- Not truly "social"

### After ✅
